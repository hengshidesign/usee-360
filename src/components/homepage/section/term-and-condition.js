                      Even if we delay in enforcing these terms, we can still
                      enforce it later

                    . If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you
                    are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in
                    taking steps against you in respect of your breaking these
                    terms, that will not mean that you do not have to do those
                    things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you
                    at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we
                    do not chase you but we continue to provide the products, we
                    can still require you to make the payment at a later date.
